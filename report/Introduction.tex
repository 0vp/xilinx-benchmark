\section{Introduction}
This test suite is used for benchmarking the bandwidth and latency of data transfers between the cpu and global memory. It focuses on benchmarking the transfer speeds of various APIs (XRT API and OpenCL/OCL) between the host and the FPGA board. \\

In this experiment, the goal is to find out the overhead of using each of the APIs, whether one API gives a speed advantage over the other. This is done by transferring data between the host and the fpga board, starting from the lowest data transfer size possible and increasing the size by powers of two.
